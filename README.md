# Go Websocket Game Time

This is a simple app written in Vue and Go to make playing a boardgame about making up fun stuff easier for me and my friends while the pandemic is keeping us all in our houses.

Just run the following

```
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8888
